    <h3>France boasts a rich and fascinating history with tennis, playing a crucial role in its evolution and development. Here's a glimpse into this historical journey:</h3>

    <h4>Early Beginnings (12th - 16th Century):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Jeu de Paume (Game of the Palm): Most historians believe that the roots of modern tennis trace back to the 12th century in France, specifically in the monastic cloisters. Back then, it was called "jeu de paume," where players used their bare hands or gloves to hit a ball against walls.
        </li>
        <li>
            Royal Appeal: The game gained popularity amongst royalty and nobility in the 16th century, leading to the development of enclosed indoor courts and more standardized rules. This version was referred to as "real tennis" or "royal tennis."
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Birth of the Modern Game (19th Century):</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Lawn Tennis: While real tennis thrived, the 19th century saw the emergence of lawn tennis in England. This version used rackets and was played on outdoor grass courts.
        </li>
        <li>
            French Championships (1891): France embraced the new form with enthusiasm, hosting the first French Championships in 1891. However, initially, it was only open to French club members.
        </li>
        <li>
            French Open (1925): In 1925, the tournament opened its doors to international amateur players and became designated as a major championship, gaining global recognition as the French Open.
        </li>
    </ul>
