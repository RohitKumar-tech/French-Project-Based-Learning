    <ul>
        <li>
            1947: France played a crucial role in establishing the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB), the international governing body for volleyball. The FIVB's first President, Paul Libaud, was French, further highlighting France's influence on the sport.
        </li>
        <li>
            Men's Volleyball: While the French men's team hasn't secured an Olympic medal yet, they have achieved impressive feats, including winning the Nations League twice (2015, 2017) and becoming European champions in 2015.
        </li>
        <li>
